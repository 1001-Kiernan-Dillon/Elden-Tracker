Elden Tacker

Elden Tracker allows players to make a user to keep track of the weapons, talismans, and items
they collect as well as they bosses they have defeated. New users can register by providing a
username, email, and password. Returning users can sign in with their username and password
allowing them to add or delete what the player has completed or collected. If a user does
not know the ID or information about what they want they can search for it in the search bar.

Start the application by running loginUI.py
